# Adventures of a Mage in Quake 2

---
Hello! This is my Mod of Quake 2.
You will spawn in as a Mage that has learned the Shell Spells.
In this world, you have spells that you can use to fight in the game.
This mod features:

- A XP SYSTEM
  - when you kill enough monsters, you will level up 
  - you get a health boost and will recover all your health
  - and you will have more shell power coursing through your body.

- All those guns? They are spells now! (they run on your SHELL power!)
  - All guns are now spells
  - some are different and some are the same as the original 
  - all of them run on SHELL so use your power accordingly!

- 5 POTIONS:
  - Potion of Light PWR: gives 2 health AND grants a small power boost
  - Potion of PWR: gives 10 health AND grants a medium power boost
  - Potion of Massive PWR: gives 25 health AND grants a LARGE power boost
  - Shard of Pellets: grants the machine gun and chain gun some more oomph
  - Jacket of Push: wanna be a jedi pushing kinda mage? this is your stuff!
